And the following methods:
 -  `introduce()`: prints out "Hi, I'm `name`, a `age` year old `gender`."
 -  `getGoal()`: prints out "My goal is: Live for the moment!"

And the following constructors:
 -  `Person(name, age, gender)`
 -  `Person()`: sets `name` to Jane Doe, `age` to 30, `gender` to female

## Student

     -  `introduce()`: "Hi, I'm `name`, a `age` year old `gender` from `previousOrganization` who skipped `skippedDays` days from the course already."
     -  `skipDays(numberOfDays)`: increases `skippedDays` by `numberOfDays`

The `Student` class has the following constructors:
 -  `Student(name, age, gender, previousOrganization)`: beside the given parameters, it sets `skippedDays` to 0
 -  `Student()`: sets `name` to Jane Doe, `age` to 30, `gender` to female, `previousOrganization` to The School of Life, `skippedDays` to 0

## Mentor

Create a `Mentor` class that has the same fields and methods as the `Person` class, and has the following additional

 -  methods:
     -  `getGoal()`: prints out "Educate brilliant junior software developers."
     -  `introduce()`: "Hi, I'm `name`, a `age` year old `gender` `level` mentor."

The `Mentor` class has the following constructors:

 -  `Mentor()`: sets `name` to Jane Doe, `age` to 30, `gender` to female, `level` to intermediate

## Sponsor

     -  `hire()`: increase `hiredStudents` by 1
     -  `getGoal()`: prints out "Hire brilliant junior software developers."

The `Sponsor` class has the following constructors:
 -  `Sponsor(name, age, gender, company)`: beside the given parameters, it sets `hiredStudents` to 0
 -  `Sponsor()`: sets `name` to Jane Doe, `age` to 30, `gender` to female, `company` to Google and `hiredStudents` to 0

## Cohort

Create a `Cohort` class that has the following
 -  fields:
     -  `name`: the name of the cohort
     -  `students`: a list of `Student`s
     -  `mentors`: a list of `Mentor`s
 -  methods:
     -  `addStudent(Student)`: adds the given `Student` to `students` list
     -  `addMentor(Mentor)`: adds the given `Mentor` to `mentors` list
     -  `info()`: prints out "The `name` cohort has `students.size()` students and `mentors.size()` mentors."

The `Cohort` class has the following constructors:
 -  `Cohort(name)`: beside the given parameter, it sets `students` and `mentors` as empty lists

## Test input

```java
ArrayList<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();

Person mark = new Person("Mark", 46, "male");
people.add(mark);
Person jane = new Person();
people.add(jane);
Student john = new Student("John Doe", 20, "male", "BME");
people.add(john);
Student student = new Student();
people.add(student);
Mentor gandhi = new Mentor("Gandhi", 148, "male", "senior");
people.add(gandhi);
Mentor mentor = new Mentor();
people.add(mentor);
Sponsor sponsor = new Sponsor();
people.add(sponsor);
Sponsor elon = new Sponsor("Elon Musk", 46, "male", "SpaceX");
people.add(elon);

student.skipDays(3);

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  elon.hire();
}

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  sponsor.hire();
}

for(Person person : people) {
  person.introduce();
  person.getGoal();
}

Cohort awesome = new Cohort("AWESOME");
awesome.addStudent(student);
awesome.addStudent(john);
awesome.addMentor(mentor);
awesome.addMentor(gandhi);
awesome.info();
```
