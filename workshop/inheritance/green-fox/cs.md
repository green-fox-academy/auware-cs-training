     -  `info()`: prints out "The `name` cohort has `students.size()` students and `mentors.size()` mentors."

The `Cohort` class has the following constructors:
 -  `Cohort(name)`: beside the given parameter, it sets `students` and `mentors` as empty lists

## Test input

```c#
var people = new List<Person>();

var mark = new Person("Mark", 46, "male");
people.Add(mark);
var jane = new Person();
people.Add(jane);
var john = new Student("John Doe", 20, "male", "BME");
people.Add(john);
var student = new Student();
people.Add(student);
var gandhi = new Mentor("Gandhi", 148, "male", "senior");
people.Add(gandhi);
var mentor = new Mentor();
people.Add(mentor);
var sponsor = new Sponsor();
people.Add(sponsor);
var elon = new Sponsor("Elon Musk", 46, "male", "SpaceX");
people.Add(elon);

student.SkipDays(3);

for ( int i = 0; i < 5; i++ )
{
    elon.Hire();
}
for ( int i = 0; i < 3; i++ ) 
{
    sponsor.Hire();
}

foreach (var person in people)
{
    person.Introduce();
    person.GetGoal();
}

Cohort awesome = new Cohort("AWESOME");
awesome.AddStudent(student);
awesome.AddStudent(john);
awesome.AddMentor(mentor);
awesome.AddMentor(gandhi);
awesome.Info();
```
